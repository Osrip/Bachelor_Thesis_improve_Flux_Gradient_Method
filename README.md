# Bachelor_Thesis_improve_Flux_Gradient_Method
Bachelor Thesis - I implemented the flux gradient method in order to calculate the turbulent transport in the atmosphere and compared the results to the Eddy-Covariance Method. The method was implemented to measurements in the Ammer Valley. Further the state-of-the-art approach of solving the flux gradient method was examined and replaced by a self-developed gradient-descent approach, which was shown to deliver more accurate results. In a more experimental approach an evolutionary algorithm was implemented to replace the state-of-the-art method.
